The first command we will play with is the `uname` command. This command displays system information of the device you are on. Such as kernel name, kernal release date, kernal version, nodename, processor type, hardware type, and the operating system.

You can use `uname` all by itself, but we will use the `-a`(all) option with it and sending the output data to its own file `> sysinfo`

`uname -a > sysinfo`

There are multiple ways to read a file, `cat` will surfice here:

`cat sysinfo`

We created a file to play with, `sed` is a streaming editor that you can use regex to change text in your file

`sed 's/64/Nachos' sysinfo`

This will only replace the first set of characters on a single line, add the `g` to replace them all on the same line

`sed 's/64/Nachos/g' sysifo`

These commands have been outputting to the terminal, but we can redirect it to its own file
n
`sed 's/64/Nachos' sysinfo > modinfo`


`grep Bob /pub/phonelist`


`man grep > grep_man`

grep -r 'word'
